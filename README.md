<h1>Online Shop Tests<h1>
This repository contains automated tests for the Social Star online shop. The tests are written in Cypress and use the Cypress Test Runner to execute the tests.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
To run these tests, you will need to have Cypress installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Cypress from the Cypress website: https://www.cypress.io/

<h1>Getting started<h1>
To get started with these tests, follow these steps:

<h1> Clone this repository to your local machine.</h1>
Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Open Cypress by running npm run cypress:open in the project directory.
Click on the "user_registration.spec.js" file to run the test suite.
  
  <h1>Running the tests</h1>
  
The "User Registration" test suite contains two tests:

<h1>  "Registers a new user"</h1>
  
This test visits the registration page, fills in the registration form with valid credentials, and verifies that the registration is successful.
"Fails to register a new user with invalid credentials"
This test visits the registration page, fills in the registration form with invalid credentials, and verifies that the registration fails with an error message.
To run these tests, follow the steps outlined in the "Getting started" section above.

The tests are written in the "user_registration.spec.js" file. The tests use Cypress commands to interact with the web page and verify that the expected behavior occurs.

Code structure
The code in this repository is organized into several folders and files:

cypress/integration/user_registration.spec.js: The test suite for user registration.
cypress/support/commands.js: Custom commands used in the tests.
cypress.json: Configuration file for Cypress.
package.json: Node.js dependencies and scripts used in the project.
README.md: This file, containing information about the project and how to run the tests.

In addition to the README file, it's also a good practice to use comments in your code to explain what each section of the code does. This makes it easier for others (and your future self!) to understand the code and make changes if necessary.
